# GR8---Find-Your-Path

An interactive platform designed to connect high school students with current college students, helping them explore academic programs and career paths through one-on-one mentorship, meetings, and lecture audits. Built with a **user-centered design** approach.

## 📌 Overview

Many high school students choose post-secondary programs based on limited exposure—often influenced by family or peers—leading to uncertainty, program switching, and delayed graduation.
**GR8 – Find Your Path Way** addresses this problem by providing:

* Direct connections with college students in various fields.
* Opportunities to schedule meetings and attend real university lectures.
* A friendly, intuitive interface designed for ease of use.

## ✨ Features

* **User Connections** – Search for and connect with college students by major, course, or field of interest.
* **Meeting & Lecture Scheduling** – Arrange 1-on-1 sessions and audit lectures directly from the platform.
* **Personalized Dashboards** – Role-specific dashboards for high school and college users.
* **Onboarding Tutorials** – Guided first-time experience for easy navigation.
* **Friend Management** – Manage connections with options to unfriend, report, or rate.
* **News & Discovery** – Expose students to new fields through curated program-related content.

## 🎯 Design Approach

We followed **human–computer interaction (HCI)** and **user-centered design** principles:

1. **User Research & Job Stories** – Identified target users' needs and challenges through formative studies.
2. **Prototyping** – Developed paper prototypes and iterated to high-fidelity prototypes in Figma.
3. **Usability Testing** – Conducted heuristic evaluations, think-aloud protocols, and System Usability Scale (SUS) surveys with both high school and college students.
4. **Iterative Refinement** – Addressed navigation issues, improved UI consistency, and reduced error rates in core tasks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Figma (high-fidelity prototype)
* **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX, Google Forms for surveys, Google Sheets for usability data
* **Methodologies:** Heuristic evaluation, think-aloud studies, SUS, pilot studies

## 📊 Key Outcomes

* **Improved Usability:** Reduced average task completion time by over 40% compared to earlier prototypes.
* **Positive User Feedback:** High school students reported increased confidence in exploring new programs.
* **Design Insights:** Identified critical UI improvements, including clearer profile-based scheduling and consistent color/font hierarchies.
